## Game Rules
The game is played between two players.
Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding up the points.
If a player rolls a 1, their current score for that turn is reset to 0, and it becomes the opponent's turn.
The player can choose to "Hold," which means their current score is added to their total score, and then it's the opponent's turn.
The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

## Features
